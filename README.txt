COMP 3641 - Java Web Application Development

Application is run from the home.html page - but is designed to run if user simply
navigates to directory.

Some messaging is configured in the web.xml file for easy changes

Database table created is called a00222500_Members
This is hard-coded into the DatabaseBean.java file - I could have designed this to be more generic
but I felt that any change to the database would take a sufficient amount expertise - thus the 
person doing this could also change the code.
